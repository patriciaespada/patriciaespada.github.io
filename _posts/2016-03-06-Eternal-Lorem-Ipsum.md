In 2017 me and my husband decided to take a sabbatical year to travel and enjoy our passion for outdoor, travel, nature and ofcourse rock climbing.

## How all begun? 
-----

We were living for almost two years in Manaus, Amazon, Brazil. The expericing of living in other country was very fullfilling but unfortunatly we didn't had the time to travel like we wanted to.

At some point we knew that we wanted to get back to the old country, Portugal, but we didn't want to go without taking the opportunity to know a little bit more of the world. So we decided to take a sabbatical year to enjoy what we love to do.

## What the journey brought to us?
-----

It was an incredible experience, not only we got the opportunity to travel in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, but also we got the opportunity to know incredible people and make some very good friends.

We went to very remote places, and adventured a lot in the mountains of this continent.

It was a very fufilling experience and we register each moment on our blog [Living Onsight](http://www.livingonsight.com).

## Where to now?
-----

The past 3 years experiences brought me to a place in my life where I really know what I love, what is important to me, and what I want for my life.

I learn that we don't need a lot to live, and mainly that we don't need to live in a big city to have a very interesting life.

For know I'm going to seek for my little place in the world, were I can live a nice life, enjoy nature, climbing, and where I can do my work in the confort of my home.
