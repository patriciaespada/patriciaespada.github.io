My name is Patrícia and I'm a portuguese Software Engineer/Full Stack Developer with more than five years of experience. I have been working mostly on development of web applications. Involved in all phases of the software development lifecycle and always looking to learn more and better. Currently working with technologies like Spring, Java, AngularJS, Ember.js, Node.js, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

I started working in a portuguese company called Opensoft. Our main project was to develop and maintain a web application to the Finance Ministry where people and companies have to submit their taxes, financial declarations and obligations. I’ve worked in that project for about 3 years, first two in a junior position and the last occuping a senior position.

In 2015 I went to live in Manaus, Brazil. There I’ve started work remotely. I’ve continue helping the portuguese company in a in-house porject called Weventual. This was a web application for managing events (e.g., sport events, conferences, and others). The application allowed users to create events, to register into an event, to deal with the payments, and more.

I also started working with a brazilian company called Integritas. Our main project was to a US company called Pearson, and the project was to develop a web application to manage schools and all associated information, for students to take their assessments and also to provide critical measures and reports about the students performance. 

My expertise is focused not only in backend development, but also in front-end, databases, dealing with the clients, and other tasks needed to get a good application up and running. Web development is something that I love doing and I really enjoy the part of learning new technologies and frameworks.

Despite this I have been a passionate rock climber, that in 2017 had the opportunity to take a sabbatical year to enjoy my passion. Check my life experience blog [Living Onsight](https://www.livingonsight.com).
